# Quasimorph Spawn Multiple Items Command

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

Executes the console's item command multiple times to drop more than one item.

Ex:
`itemx water 10`

Will drop 10 water bottles.

Note that this command will not stack items as it simply invokes the game's item command multiple times.
