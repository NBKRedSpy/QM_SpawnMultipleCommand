# Quasimorph Spawn Multiple Items Command

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

# Important - This is only for the opt in beta version of the game!

This is a temporary version that supports the 0.8.6 beta, and not the current game's version.
The non beta version *must* be uninstalled.  
When the 0.8.6 becomes the main version, this mod will be deleted.
Note that the beta is expected to change many times before release.
As such, this mod may break on each beta release.

# Docs

Executes the console's item command multiple times to drop more than one item.

Ex:
`itemx water 10`

Will drop 10 water bottles.

Note that this command will not stack items as it simply invokes the game's item command multiple times.
